**Project Objectives:**


The objective of this project is to deliver an open-source avionics package that can store and broadcast flight data to a base station during a controlled flight.

* Controlled Rocket
* Launch platform
* Opensource only
* Communication with base station
    * Location
    * Rocket status
* Write to SD card
* land without damage

#### Budget
The budget is not solid but the team is working with the expectation of the solid value of $300.
This will be spent exclusively on hardware, such as electronics, rocket engines, printing PCB designs, etc..

The exact details of these are unknown at this stage, but the broader definitions of some Components that are known are listed below:
* A Microcontroller
* Servos for Gimbal
* At least one C or D class Engine.
* Cost of printing the PCB in the Rocket.
* The IMU
* Others sensors in the rocket
* Components for Communications from the rocket
* A LoRa receiver as the base station
* Any costs regarding the rocket model itself
* Battery
