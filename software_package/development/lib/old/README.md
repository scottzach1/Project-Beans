# Update 13/10/2020
As of this date, this package remains deprecated. This package represents the
very first iteration of the project's structure and the team's attempt at PlatformIO. After some iterations in the project, the team realized that the
architecture of the software had to be replaced to better align with the
requirements of the project. The replacement process resulted in the abandonment of
the existing architecture (as presented by this package) and the re-creation of 
an entirely new architecture.

**Contents of this package are outdated and should not be used. This package
remains in the project's repository to give an idea of how the architecture 
of the software system has evolved over time.**
