# Unit testing for this project

The unit tests located in this package should be unit tests on aspects of the software system
that are completely independent of adafruit libraries. See [here](../../README.md) for more details.

Note: If you wish to add unit tests, please add to a test file already located within `test_no_adafruit_deps`. Alternatively, you
can create a separate file within this directory and write the unit tests there. **Be sure to follow the proper test file naming convention `test_*.cpp` !**
