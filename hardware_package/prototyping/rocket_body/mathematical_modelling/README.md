#### Mathematical modelling:
This directory will contain mathematical relations between certain aspects of the rocket that the control system will need along with a block diagram connecting them all.

**Working on/completed**
- WIP: Motor angle to gimbal angle relation. (will include digital conversion for PWM signal to servos)
- WIP: Block diagram
- Torque relation on rocket body (gimbal angle and force of engine relative to center of mass, will not take into account drag initially (will be simplified when it is))
