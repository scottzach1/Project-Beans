#### Mathematical modelling:
Changes since talking to Andre about this: The avionics package is what we are delivering rather that the rocket. Users will have their own rockets most likely so having any modelling that is specific to the rocket body is not worth doing.


~~This directory will contain mathematical relations between certain aspects of the rocket that the control system will need along with a block diagram connecting them all.~~

**Working on/completed**
- WIP: Motor angle to gimbal angle relation. (will include digital conversion for PWM signal to servos) (will be included in future issue)
- Block diagram for avionics control system done.
- ~~Torque relation on rocket body (gimbal angle and force of engine relative to center of mass, will not take into account drag initially (will be simplified when it is))~~
