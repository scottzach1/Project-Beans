# Notes on Power Supply Designs

Prototypes were created using the Free online tool, WEBENCH
POWERDESIGNER ([Link](https://webench.ti.com/power-designer/)).
Currently in this directory are the designs for DC-DC supplies that
provide the voltage rails. What must be designed still are the battery
protection circuits and ignition circuits.

Note: These designs are only Prototypes. PCB Layouts are generated by
software and are only to give an idea of final layout, will be altered
to fit in a larger PCB diagram with all sections of the overall power
supply.
