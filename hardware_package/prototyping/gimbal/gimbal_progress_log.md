#### Gimbal Prototyping Document:

This document will contain progress of the gimbal and any important decisions made at each stage. Measurements and requirement will be included also.

|| C class | D class | E class | F class |
|-|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| **Diameter (min)** | 18mm | 24mm | 24mm | 29mm |
| **Length (min)** | 70mm | 70mm | 95mm | 114mm |

#### Prototype 1:

Log:
* Prototype 1 Gimbal components created in Onshape (sprint 4)
* Assembly of components and servos finished in Onshape (sprint 5)
* ToDo: Print Prototype 1 in sprint 5

###### Considerations for P2 based on P1:
* There are a few sections on corners that are too thin and may break. These must be filled out.
* There are several considerations regarding bolt mounts that must be changed.
  * Must be reinforced else bolts will crack the plastic.
  * Diameter of holes should be 0.2mm less than the bolts, this will allow the bolt to thread the plastic.
  * Nuts are not entirely necessary for servo mounts. Can just make deeper holes.
* Servo Measurements were incorrect in P1.
* P1 has 20 degrees of freedom in one axis and 10 in the other. This seems sufficient and should be retained.
* Generally thicker to ensure strength.
* Should minimize overhangs for better printing.
* P2 should have mounts for the rocket, distance between center of mass and gimbal rotation axes must be considered (cannot be too small else insufficient torque on the rocket for change of angle).



#### Prototype 2:
Specs:
- M3 bolt size
-



Log:
* Create and assemble prototype 2 (for 24mm engine)
