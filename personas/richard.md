**Age:** 73

**Profession:** Retired (ex broadcasting engineer).

**Blurb:** Richard is a retired man who has a deep passion for his
family and dry humor. Richard is now in his 70s and has been married
happily for 30 years. Back in the days, he used to be a broadcasting
technician. Richard initially got interested in this rocketing project
as a plea to spend more time with his grandchildren. Although Richard
isn’t particularly knowledgeable with the technology in this hobby, his
passion has been reignited from the youthful memories of the 60s.

***Background Knowledge and Skills:***

- From his old years in broadcast engineering, Richard has a great
  understanding of the lower level science behind radio. This knowledge
  also extends to a good understanding of physics from his youth.
- Richard has little to no experience with programming. This project
  will definitely be testing his capabilities with modern technology.

***Motivations:***

- The main motivation for this project is to allow him to spend more
  time bonding with his grandchildren. Now that they both attend school,
  sadly he doesn’t get to look after them during the day like he used
  to.
- Although not the main motivation, part of the excitement with this
  project stems from the nostalgia from his youthful years of the
  astronomy club back in the 1960s.

***Information Processing Style:***

- Although relatively proficient with science, dealing with technology
  on the computer is definitely going to test his patience.
- Although computers are not his forte, Richard will eat up all of the
  science as it is a fun and great opportunity to teach the grand kids
  some valuable skills.

***Attitude to technology:***

- ***Computer self-efficacy:*** Richard isn’t particularly good with
  computers. The family desktop is still running Windows 7 and he still
  uses an outdated Mozilla Thunderbird to check his ‘@xtra’ email
  account. Dealing with code for this project will definitely be an
  uphill battle for him. Richards biggest hope is for the software to be
  relatively plug and play. This would be even more preferable to well
  documented software. Whatever it is, should just work. No shenanigans!
  Worst case perhaps some of the kids can help him get everything setup?
  They must be pretty proficient with all those hours of Minecraft!
- ***Attitude towards risk:*** All those years of broadcasting has made
  Richard very safety conscious. The last thing he would ever want is
  for his grandchildren to be harmed. He sure would appreciate a section
  guiding him for safe usage.
- ***Learning Process vs Tinkering:*** Richard is a very structured
  person, he likes everything to be very ordered and organized.
  Everything should be well documented and contain instructions. Richard
  would preferably not want to deviate far from the project. Having an
  actual list of components would help reassure him that everything will
  all go to plan.
