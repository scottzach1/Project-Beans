# Jeffery

**Age:** 13

**Profession:** Exchange student from Tokyo, currently at Maidstone Intermediate

**Blurb:** Jeffery is currently on an exchange from their school in Tokyo with Maidstone Intermediate. They enjoy a wide range of activities which include various video games, hockey and drawing. Part of the reason they are on this exchange is to improve their English, as well as to experience life in another country.

***Background knowledges and skills:***
- Part of Jeffery’s wide range of classes at school includes Computer Science, which they thoroughly enjoy. At the moment they’re working on creating an interactive story in Scratch.
- Jeffery is a huge fan of Kerbal Space Program, and can spend hours at a time in this game. This along with a couple other games and videos has formed a deep passion for space and exploration in Jeffery. While they may not necessarily realise it, they’ve taken in a bunch of information about rockets and are actually reasonably knowledgeable on how different components and pieces of rocket systems interact.

***Motivations:***
- Jeffery is enjoying their projects in Computer Science, and is now looking to combine this with their other passions.
- Part of the reason they wish to expand their knowledge in computer science is that they find writing code a fun way of practicing their language comprehension.

***Information Processing Style:***
- Jeffery is a hands on learner, and finds diving into and experiencing something new really helps them to better understand it.

***Attitude to Technology:***

- ***Computer self-efficacy:*** Between communicating with friends and family back home, playing games and school they have developed a comfort with all things related to technology. Jeffery is completely open to new technology, as they know the time spent learning it will often pay dividends.
- ***Attitude towards risk:*** Jeffery is understanding that most actions come with consequences, and will usually analyse these before jumping into anything. They do however tend to have a lower “risk tolerance” and will often jump into a task anyway if they feel that the worst case scenario isn’t too bad.
- ***Learning Process vs Tinkering:*** Jeffery is 100% a tinkerer, and will always learn best by diving into a problem and developing their own internal mapping of it. You’ll find that their school projects are often receiving more attention than their respective lessons.
