**Profession:** Business Analyst for Transpower

**Blurb:** Molly is a longtime member of  the model rocketry hobby community, and has a passion for all things rocketry and space. When they aren’t at work Molly often spends their time keeping themselves up to date with all of the latest news, and often will try to tune in to watch companies like NASA perform live launches. Molly also enjoys crime podcasts, and taking their dog for extended walks in the trails.

***Background Knowledge and Skills:***
- Molly is a longtime and extremely active in the model rocketry hobby community, and tries to keep up with all of the latest developments and technology.
- One of Molly’s ongoing personal projects is building their own model rocket with a class C motor. They love to tinker away at the components and get a deeper understanding of how they operate.
- As a long time model rocket hobbyist Molly is accustomed to the rules and regulations around flying model rockets, as well as the design constraints that can be imposed.

***Motivations:***
- The main reason that Molly looks at other projects that fellow members of the model rocketry hobby community is to learn from them to enhance their own rocket. They love to see all of the different components and approaches people use. In particular they like to see the outcomes of these, so they know what components may or may not have success in their own rocket.
- Another key motivation which keeps Molly involved in other’s projects is their love of seeing others use new technology. They enjoy seeing how each of the components can be advanced and improved on to achieve even greater things.

***Information Processing Style:***
- When facing new challenges and difficulties Molly finds that its best to invest their time in forming a fuller understanding of the problem. They find that it works best for them to research and then come up with a sound plan to overcome an obstacle.

***Attitude to technology:***

- ***Computer self-efficacy:*** Molly is extremely comfortable around technology, and considers themselves to have an above average knowledge on computers. With their work they need to use a wide range of software, which they feel has given them the experience to learn and adapt to almost any new software.
- ***Attitude towards risk:*** Molly feels a lot more comfortable using systems which they know to be robust. They don’t like to use unproven pieces of technology, and would rather wait to see others use and test these for them.
- ***Learning Process vs Tinkering:***  In general Molly leans to a more process oriented approach, and finds reading up on new concepts to work best for them. Only once they feel comfortable in their knowledge of a system will they actually attempt to implement it.
