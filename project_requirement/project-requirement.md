# ENGR 301: Project Requirements Document

The aim of this document is to specify the requirements of the system your group is to build. The focus of a requirements document is the problem you are attempting to solve:  not a first attempt at a solution to that problem. This document should communicate clearly to the supervisor, client and course coordinator what the system you build is going to do, and what constraints it must meet while doing so.

The document should also demonstrate your understanding of the main analysis principles and quality guidelines, and applicable standards, using tools and notations as necessary to communicate the requirements precisely, unambiguously and clearly in a written technical document. Page specifications below are *limits not targets* and refer to the pages in the PDF generated from the markdown. Because the size of your document is necessarily limited, you should ensure that you focus your efforts on those requirements that are most important to completing a successful system: if sections are at their page limit, indicate how many items would be expected in a complete specification. 

The ENGR 301 project proposal and requirements document should be based on the standard ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148:2011(E), primarily sections 8.4 and 9.5, plus section 9.4 for projects involving hardware and ISO 25010 SQuaRE for systemic requirements. While excerpts from the standard have been quoted within the template, to understand what is required it will be necessary to read earlier sections of the standards themselves. A supplementary treatment of requirements gathering in engineering projects may be found in [Requirements in Engineering Projects](https://victoria.rl.talis.com/items/F166DA94-DAD8-FBDB-0785-7A63C9BA3603.html?referrer=%2Flists%2F5886F297-2506-1F17-45D9-7F04CEE284EE.html%23item-F166DA94-DAD8-FBDB-0785-7A63C9BA3603) (Talis). The requirements document should contain the sections listed below, and conform to the formatting rules listed at the end of this brief. 

All team members are expected to contribute equally to the document and list their contributions in section 6 of the document. You should work on your document in your team's GitLab repository. While collective contributions are expected to be the exception rather than the rule, if more than one team member has contributed to a particular commit then all those team member IDs should be included in the first line of the git commit message. `git blame`, `git diff`, file histories, etc. will be tools used to assess individual contributions, so everyone is encouraged to contribute individually, commit early and commit often. Any team wishing to separate individually contributed sections into a single file before collation into the single proposal document for submission is welcome to do so.

### 1.3 Product overview 
#### 1.3.1 Product perspective

One page defining the system's relationship to other related products
(9.5.3. but not the subsections in the standard.)

> **9.5.3 Product perspective** <br>
> Define the system's relationship to other related products. 
> 
> If the product is an element of a larger system, then relate the requirements of that larger system to the functionality of the product covered by the software requirements specification.
> 
> If the product is an element of a larger system, then identify the interfaces between the product covered by the software requirements specification and the larger system of which the product is an element. 
>
> A block diagram showing the major elements of the larger system, interconnections, and external interfaces can be helpful.
> 
> Describe how the software operates within the following constraints:  
a) System interfaces;  
b) User interfaces;  
c) Hardware interfaces;  
d) Software interfaces;  
e) Communications interfaces;  
f) Memory;  
g) Operations;  
h) Site adaptation requirements.

#### 1.3.2 Product functions

One page summary of the main functions of the product (9.5.4), briefly characterising the minimum viable product.

#### 1.3.3 User characteristics   

One page identifying the main classes of users and their characteristics (9.5.5) 

#### 1.3.4 Limitations

One page on the limitations on the product (9.5.6)

## 2. References

References to other documents or standards. Follow the IEEE Citation  Reference scheme, available from the [IEEE website](https://www.ieee.org/) (please use the search box). (1 page, longer if required)

## 3. Specific requirements  

20 pages outlining the requirements of the system. You should apportion these pages across the following subsections to focus on the most important parts of your product.

### 3.1 External interfaces

See 9.5.10. for most systems this will be around one page. 

### 3.2 Functions

This is typically the longest subsection in the document. List up to fifty use cases (in order of priority for development), and for at least top ten focal use cases, write a short goal statement and use case body (up to seven pages).  Identify the use cases that comprise a minimum viable product.

### 3.3 Usability Requirements

See 9.5.12. for most systems this will be around one page.

> **9.5.12 Usability requirements**<br>
> Define usability (quality in use) requirements. Usability requirements and objectives for the software system include measurable effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction criteria in specific contexts of use.

### 3.4 Performance requirements

See 9.5.13. for most systems this will be around one page. Hardware projects also see section 9.4.6.

> **9.5.13 Performance requirements** <br>
> Specify both the static and the dynamic numerical requirements placed on the software or on human interaction with the software as a whole. 
> 
> Static numerical requirements may include the following:
> 
> a) The number of terminals to be supported;  
> b) The number of simultaneous users to be supported;  
> c) Amount and type of information to be handled.
> 
> Static numerical requirements are sometimes identified under a separate section entitled Capacity.
> 
> Dynamic numerical requirements may include, for example, the numbers of transactions and tasks and the amount of data to be processed within certain time periods for both normal and peak workload conditions. The performance requirements should be stated in measurable terms.
> 
>  For example, "_95 % of the transactions shall be processed in less than 1 second._" rather than, "An operator shall not have to wait for the transaction to complete."
> 
> NOTE Numerical limits applied to one specific function are normally specified as part of the processing subparagraph description of that function.


### 3.5 Logical database requirements

See 9.5.14. for most systems, a focus on d) and e) is appropriate, such as an object-oriented domain analysis. You should provide an overview domain model (e.g.  a UML class diagram of approximately ten classes) and write a brief description of the responsibilities of each class in the model (3 pages).

You should use right tools, preferabley PlantUML, to draw your URL diagrams which can be easily embedded into a Mardown file (PlantUML is also supported by GitLab and Foswiki).

### 3.6 Design constraints

see 9.5.15 and 9.5.16. for most systems, this will be around one page.

> 9.5.15 Design constraints<br>
> Specify constraints on the system design imposed by external standards, regulatory requirements, or project limitations.
> 
> 9.5.16 Standards compliance<br>
> Specify the requirements derived from existing standards or regulations, including:
> 
> a) Report format;<br>
> b) Data naming;<br>
> c) Accounting procedures;<br>
> d) Audit tracing.
> 
> For example, this could specify the requirement for software to trace processing activity. Such traces are needed for some applications to meet minimum regulatory or financial standards. An audit trace requirement may, for example, state that all changes to a payroll database shall be recorded in a trace file with before and after values.

### 3.7 Nonfunctional system attributes

Present the systemic (aka nonfunctional) requirements of the product (see ISO/IEC 25010).
List up to twenty systemic requirements / attributes.
Write a short natural language description of the top nonfunctional requirements (approx. five pages).


### 3.8 Physical and Environmental Requirements 

For systems with hardware components, identify the physical characteristics of that hardware (9.4.10) and environment conditions in which it must operate (9.4.11).  Depending on the project, this section may be from one page up to 5 pages.

### 3.9 Supporting information

see 9.5.19. 

## 4. Verification

3 pages outlining how you will verify that the product meets the most important specific requirements. The format of this section should parallel section 3 of your document (see 9.5.18). Wherever possible (especially systemic requirements) you should indicate testable acceptance criteria.

## 5. Development schedule.

### 5.1 Schedule

Identify dates for key project deliverables: 

1. architectural prototype
1. minimum viable product
1. further releases

(1 page).

### 5.2 Budget

Present a budget for the project (table), and justify each budget item (one paragraph per item, one page overall). 

### 5.3 Risks 

Identify the ten most important project risks to achieving project goals: their type, likelihood, impact, and mitigation strategies (3 pages).

If the project will involve any work outside the ECS laboratories, i.e. off-campus activities, these should be included in the following section.

### 5.4 Health and Safety

Document here project requirements for Health and Safety. All teams must state in this section:

1. How teams will manage computer-related risks such as Occupational Over Use, Cable management, etc.  

2. Whether project work requires work or testing at any external (off-campus) workplaces/sites. If so, state the team's plans for receiving a Health and Safety induction for the external workplaces/sites. If the team has already received such an induction, state the date it was received. 

3. Whether project work requires the team test with human or animal subjects? If so, explain why there is no option but for the team to perform this testing, and state the team's plans for receiving Ethics Approval _prior_ to testing.

Also document in this section any additional discussions with the School Safety Officer regarding Health and Safety risks. Give any further information on relevant health and safety regulations, risks, and mitigations, etc.


#### 5.4.1 Safety Plans

Safety Plans may be required for some projects, depending on project requirements. Safety Plan templates are available on the course Health & Safety page. Two questions all teams must answer are:

**Do project requirements involve anything that can cause serious harm or death?**  
Examples: building/modifying devices using voltages > 60 V, chemicals, large moving machinery, flying devices, bodies of water.

If so, you will have to write a separate Safety Plan as part of project requirements, and the Safety Plan must be referenced in this section. For health and safety risks involving serious harm or death, you must first contact the School Safety Officer and Course Coordinator first to discuss the Safety Plan and project requirements.

**Do project requirements involve anything that can cause harm or injury?**  
Examples: building/modifying things with voltages <= 60V, small moving machinery, wearable devices.

If so, you will have to write a separate Safety Plan as part of project requirements, and the Safety Plan must be referenced in this section. For health and safety risks involving harm or injury, you should write a draft of the Safety Plan before contacting the School Safety Officer and Course Coordinator to discuss the Safety Plan and project requirements.

If a safety plan is required, list in this section the date the School Safety officer accepted your Health and Safety plan (if accepted by submission date).

_If the project is purely software and requires no contact risks involving physical harm, then state "Project requirements do not involve risk of death, serious harm, harm or injury." in this section._


## 6. Appendices
### 6.1 Assumptions and dependencies 

One page on assumptions and dependencies (9.5.7).

### 6.2 Acronyms and abbreviations

One page glossary _as required_.

## 7. Contributions

A one page statement of contributions, including a list of each member of the group and what they contributed to this document.

## Formatting Rules 

 * Write your document using [Markdown](https://gitlab.ecs.vuw.ac.nz/help/user/markdown#gitlab-flavored-markdown-gfm) and ensure you commit your work to your team's GitLab repository.
 * Major sections should be separated by a horizontal rule.


## Assessment  

The goal of a requirements document is the problem you are attempting to solve:  not a first attempt at a solution to that problem. The most important factor in the assessmernt of the document is how will it meet that goal. The document will be assessed for both presentation and content. 

The presentation will be based on how easy it is to read, correct spelling, grammar, punctuation, clear diagrams, and so on.

The content will be assessed according to its clarity, consistency, relevance, critical engagement and a demonstrated understanding of the material in the course. We look for evidence these traits are represented and assess the level of performance against these traits. While being comprehensive and easy to understand, this document must be reasonably concise too. You will be affected negatively by writing a report with too many pages (far more than what has been suggested for each section above).

We aim to evaluate ENGR301 documents and projects as if they were real projects rather than academic exercises &mdash; especially as they are real projects with real clients. The best way to get a good mark in a document is to do the right thing for your project, your client, and your team. We encourage you to raise questions with your tutor or course staff, as soon as possible, so you can incorporate their feedback into your work.
