## Safety Plan

Note: This Safety Plan is valid for the first milestone of the project.
***TODO: do we have a launch document?***

Name: Project Beans (Group 3) Project Name: Avionics and Control Project
Start Date: 17 March 2020 Project End Date: 16 November 2020

Risk profile of the project : Major

The most severe risk that this package entails is the rocket falling on
a person causing serious injury.

## Section 1 - The Rocket

> - maximum weight
> - maximum length
> - motor specs
> - OpenRocket for test simulations
>

> > - worst case scenario based on sims
>
> - no metal parts (complying with **NZ Model Rocketry Safety Code**)
> - ignition safety locks
> - **CAA requirements** of 20 Newtown-seconds impulse is not met so
>   technically isn't a rocket
> - no recovery charge required so should be deactivated.

***TODO***

- talk about simulations - are we using openrocket?
- Written assuming D motor

The rocket has a weight of **TODO** and a length of **TODO**.

According to the CAA Regulation 101.3 a rocket is defined as "a
pilotless vehicle propelled by a system that contains every ingredient
needed to form its own jet other than a rocket propelled by a model
rocket motor of size A-D which achieves no more than 20 Newton-seconds
of total impulse". As our rocket has a class D motor, and is achieves
**TODO: EXACT** under 20 Newton-seconds of thrust it is not classified
as a rocket by the CAA. Despite this, the team still aims to fully
comply with and follow their guidelines as if it were to be considered a
rocket.

The team also aims to fully comply with the NZ Model Rocketry Safety
Code. This means that the nose, body and fins of the rocket does not
contain any metal parts. It is built around a **TODO** motor from
**TODO** manufacturer, which contains **TODO** substances. This motor
will not be modified in any way from its manufactured state, nor will it
be used in anyway not recommended by the manufacturer.

The rocket has **TODO: EXACT** a recovery system, which ensures that the
rocket can return safely and undamaged from a flight.

The launch system for this rocket is electrical and uses electrical
motor ignitors. The launch system also has a safety interlock which
works in series with the launch switch.

Finally, the launch exclusion zone for a class D motor is 150 m in
diameter. This means that 75 m in all directions of the rocket must be
cleared before launch of the rocket.

### 2.1 - Travel Plan

> - heat required for ignition (288°)
> - rocket must be kept away from any source of heat > 50°
> - at all times multiple persons of contact present
> - mitigate getting lost or injured
> - mobile phones for communication
> - rocket classified as Class 1 Dangerous Goods according to **Land
>   Transport Rule: Dangerous Goods 2005**
>
> > - designated member of staff contacted upon return to confirm safety
> >   of participants
> > - if designated member receives no contact within an hour after
> >   expected arrival they should take emrgency.
> > - this action is laid out in launch documents

\[DRAFT]

To launch the rocket, the motor requires a temperature of 288 °C. To
mitigate any risks of accidental ignition; which may cause serious
damage or injury, the rocket must be kept away from any source of heat
greater than 50 °C. At all times during transportation, there must be
multiple persons of contact present. This can aid in any unforeseen
circumstances such as getting lost, injured or concerns about the
rocket. To ensure this communication is available, it is mandatory the
group must have at least one mobile device with enough credit for
texting / calls.

In accordance with the New Zealand Land Transport Rule:
[Dangerous Goods 2005](https://www.nzta.govt.nz/resources/rules/dangerous-goods-2005/),
the motor is classified as Class 1 under division
[§1.4](https://www.nzta.govt.nz/resources/rules/dangerous-goods-2005/#1).
To fulfill the requirements set out under the act, a designated member
of staff must be contacted upon return to confirm safety of
participants. In the circumstance that the designated member of staff
receives contact from the party within an hour after expected arrival.
They should immediately try to communicate with the party. If no contact
can be made, the designated member should take emergency action.
Alternative points of contact and actions to be undertaken will be laid
out within the launch documents.

### 2.2 - Environment

> - **CAA regulations Part 101.157 and Part 101.159**
> - flight during daylight hours
> - flight cancelled under following weather conditions:
>
> > - Cloud cover which obscures more than half of the visible sky
> > - Conditions which limit horizontal visibility to less than 8km.
> > - Heavy precipitation
> > - High wind speed (speeds exceeding 32 km/h)
>
> - resources to check conditions
>
> > - Accuweather - hourly expected wind speeds / wind gust speeds
> > - Wind Finder - live data - wind speed and dir
> > - Metservice - three hourly weather measurements
>
> - not launched into clouds (**CAA regulations Part 101.157**)
> - all members of general public using park at launch time notified
>
> > - if they refuse to comply or >10 members of public launch must be
> >   postponed
>
> - throughout launch three members stationed at max launch radius to
>   ensure general public do not enter zone

\[DRAFT]

In accordance with
***[CAA regulations Part 101.157 and Part1.159](https://www.aviation.govt.nz/rules/rule-part/show/101)***
as series of constraints will be applied to the conditions for which the
rocket will be launched. Launch times for the rocket are strictly
limited to daylight hours. The rockets launch is also strictly depends
on the weather conditions. If any of the following conditions regarding
the current weather are present, then the rocket launch cannot take
place at the time. **CAA regulations Part 101.157** strictly specifies,
that the rocket must not be launched into the clouds. More details on
the specifications are as follows:

- Cloud cover which obscures more than half of the visible sky.
- Conditions which limit horizontal visibility to less than 8 km.
- Heavy precipitation.
- High wind speed (speeds exceeding 32 km/h). To verify these
  environmental conditions are within safe limits, the following online
  resources must be utilised:
- Accuweather - hourly expected wind speeds / wind gust speeds.
- Wind Finder - live data for wind speed and direction.
- Metservice - three-hourly wind measurements.

Before rocket launch, all members of the general public using park at
launch time must be notified. If they refuse to comply to provided
instructions or there are more than 10 members of the public present,
then launch must be postponed. If previously outlined conditions are
met, throughout the entire launch and flight procedure three members are
to be stationed at max launch radius to ensure that no member of the
general public enters the radius zone.

### 2.3 Equipment

- checklist of all gear and owner

### 2.4 Supervision

Launch procedure will be overseen by Andre Geldenhuis. Andre is a member
of the NZ Rocketry Association and is an expert in the field of Model
Rocketry. As such Andre will be responsible for the launch and
deactivation of recovered charges as necessary. Andre will be
responsible for transporting the required motors to and from the launch
site, a procedure he is well familiar with. The launch rail and pad will
also be provided by Andre.

### 2.5 Launch

As per CAA regulations part(101.161), Air Traffic Control does not
require prior notice to any launch attempts as the rocket is classified
under CAA regulations as a, "large model rocket" part(101.3).
Additionally, features of the surrounding landscape i.e hills and trees
are likely to dwarf the maximum apogee of the rocket minimizing the risk
of interference from foreign aircraft.

Upon arriving at the launch destination, team members will conduct a
safety inspection of the surroundings. Any hazards will be noted and
procedure deemed necessary to help mitigate these hazards will be
conducted accordingly. As required by the NZRA Safety Code, team members
will ensure there is no dry grass close to the launch pad which could
present a risk of grass fire. A blast deflector will also remain in
place under the rocket to prevent the motor's exhaust from hitting the
ground and further minimise risk of fire.

The rocket will be launched at an angle no greater than 30 degrees to
the vertical to ensure the rocket lands close to the launch pad. Once
all participants have approved of the launch arrangements, Andre
Geldenhuis will activate the launch sequence.

In keeping with NZRA Safety Code, software will implement a 10-second
countdown timer. Once started, this timer can be cancelled remotely at
the request of any team member. This will ensure all participants are
notified and prepared for launch. In the event of a misfire, safety
interlocks will be put back in place, and the team will remain on
standby for a full minute before approaching the rocket.

### 2.6 Unforeseen Events

#### 2.6.1 Members of the Public

Due to the launch occurring on public premises, members of the public
may approach team members or otherwise pose a safety threat. In any such
event, the individual will be referred to Andre. Any complaints or
enquiries that cannot be handled on site will be passed on to Aaron
Chen.

#### 2.6.2 Faulty Components

If a component of the rocket is found to be faulty prior to launch,
Andre will remove the motor, and the team will attempt to fix the
component. Otherwise, if any issues are identified with the motors Andre
will, after waiting a minute, approach the rocket and inspect the motor
to determine whether it is safe before permitting any team members to
approach.
