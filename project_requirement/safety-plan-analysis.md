## Safety Plan

Note: This Safety Plan is valid for the first milestone of the project.
**TODO: do we have a launch document?**

Name: Project Beans (Group 3)
Project Name: Avionics and Control
Project Start Date: 17 March 2020
Project End Date: 16 November 2020

Risk profile of the project : Major

The most severe risk that this package entails is the rocket falling on a person causing serious injury.

## Section 1 - The Rocket
> - maximum weight
- maximum length
- motor specs
- OpenRocket for test simulations
 - Results of the simulations - estimates/averages
 - worst case scenario based on sims
- no metal parts (complying with **NZ Model Rocketry Safety Code**)
- ignition safety locks
- **CAA requirements** of 20 Newtown-seconds impulse is not met so technically isn't a rocket
- no recovery charge required so is deactivated
- designed to tumble after burnout
- **New Zealand Rocketry Association safety code**
>  - minimum dimensions of launch clear zone respective to motor (C class)

**TODO**
- talk about simulations - are we using openrocket?
- Written assuming D motor

The rocket has a weight of **TODO** and a length of **TODO**.

According to the CAA Regulation 101.3 a rocket is defined as "a pilotless vehicle propelled by a system that contains every ingredient needed to form its own jet other than a rocket propelled by a model rocket motor of size A-D which
achieves no more than 20 Newton-seconds of total impulse". As our rocket has a class D motor, and is achieves **TODO: EXACT** under 20 Newton-seconds of thrust it is not classified as a rocket by the CAA. Despite this, the team still aims to fully comply with and follow their guidelines as if it were to be considered a rocket.

The team also aims to fully comply with the NZ Model Rocketry Safety Code. This means that the nose, body and fins of the rocket does not contain any metal parts.  It is built around a **TODO** motor from **TODO** manufacturer, which contains **TODO** substances. This motor will not be modified in any way from its manufactured state, nor will it be used in anyway that is not recommended by the manufacturer.

The rocket has **TODO: EXACT** a recovery system, which ensures that the rocket can return safely and undamaged from a flight.

The launch system for this rocket is electrical and uses electrical motor ignitors. The launch system also has a safety interlock which works in series with the launch switch.

Finally, the launch exclusion zone for a class D motor is 150m in diameter. This means that 75m in all directions of the rocket must be cleared before launch of the rocket.


## Section 2 - Launch Details
- see launch documents

#### 2.1 - Travel Plan
> - heat required for ignition (288°)
> - rocket must be kept away from any source of heat > 50°
> - at all times multiple persons of contact present
> - mitigate getting lost or injured
> - mobile phones for communication
> - rocket classified as Class 1 Dangerous Goods according to **Land Transport Rule: Dangerous Goods 2005**
>> - designated member of staff contacted upon return to confirm safety of participants
>> - if designated member receives no contact within an hour after expected arrival they should take emrgency
>> - this action is laid out in launch documents

[DRAFT]

To launch the rocket, the motor requires a temperature of 288°C. To mitigate any risks of accidental ignition; which
may cause serious damage or injury, the rocket must be kept away from any source of heat greater than 50°C. At all times
during transportation, there must be multiple persons of contact present. This can aid in any unforeseen circumstances
such as getting lost, injured or concerns about the rocket. To ensure this communication is available, it is mandatory
the group must have at least one mobile device with enough credit for texting / calls.   

In accordance with the New Zealand Land Transport Rule: [Dangerous Goods 2005](https://www.nzta.govt.nz/resources/rules/dangerous-goods-2005/),
the motor is classified as Class 1 under division [§1.4](https://www.nzta.govt.nz/resources/rules/dangerous-goods-2005/#1).
To fulfill the requirements set out under the act, a designated member of staff must  be contacted upon return to
confirm safety of participants. In the circumstance that the designated member of staff receives contact from the party
within an hour after expected arrival. They should immediately try to communicate with the party. If no contact can be
made, the designated member should take emergency action. Alternative points of contact and actions to be undertaken
will be laid out within the launch documents.

#### 2.2 - Environment
> - **CAA regulations Part 101.157 and Part 101.159**
> - flight during daylight hours
> - flight cancelled under following weather conditions:
>> - Cloud cover which obscures more than half of the visible sky
>> - Conditions which limit horizontal visibility to less than 8km.
>> - Heavy precipitation
>> - High wind speed (speeds exceeding 32 km/h)
> - resources to check conditions
>> - Accuweather - hourly expected wind speeds / wind gust speeds
>> - Wind Finder - live data - wind speed and dir
>> - Metservice - three hourly weather measurements
> - not launched into clouds (**CAA regulations Part 101.157**)
> - all members of general public using park at launch time notified
>> - if they refuse to comply or >10 members of public launch must be postponed
> - throughout launch three members stationed at max launch radius to ensure general public do not enter zone

[DRAFT]

 In accordance with ***[CAA regulations Part 101.157 and Part1.159](https://www.aviation.govt.nz/rules/rule-part/show/101)***
 as series of constraints will be applied to the conditions for which the rocket will be launched. Launch times for the
 rocket are strictly limited to daylight hours. The rockets launch is also strictly dependend on the weather conditions.
 If any of the following conditions regarding the current weather are present, then the rocket launch cannot take place
 at the time. **CAA regulations Part 101.157** strictly specifies, that the rocket must not be launched into the clouds.
 More details on the specifications are as follows:

- Cloud cover which obscures more than half of the visible sky.
- Conditions which limit horizontal visibility to less than 8km.
- Heavy precipitation.
- High wind speed (speeds exceeding 32 km/h).
To verify these environmental conditions are within safe limits, the following online resources must be utilised:
- Accuweather - hourly expected wind speeds / wind gust speeds.
- Wind Finder - live data for wind speed and direction.
- Metservice - threee hourly wind measurements.

Before rocket launch, all members of the general public using park at launch time must be notified. If they refuse to
comply to provided instructions or there are more than 10 members of the public present, then launch must be postponed.
If previously outlined conditions are met, throughout the entire launch and flight procedure three members are to be
stationed at max launch radius to ensure that no member of the general public enters the radius zone.   

#### 2.3 Equipment
 - checklist of all gear and owner

#### 2.4 Supervision
 - supervised by Andre
  - has Andre responsible for:
    - launch
    - deactivation
    - transportation
    - launch rail and pad
 - **we should probably meet/ask him about this**

#### 2.5 - Launch
 - NOTAM
  - as per  **CAA regulations Part 101.161** traffic control does not require notification
  - hills and buildings nearby are closer than max  height of rocket therefore no aircraft
 - safety inspection upon arrival
  - flammable materials in a 3 metre radius around the launcher removed **NZ Rocketry Association
safety code Section 2-14.2**
  - if necessary a blast deflector will be used to prevent the motor’s exhaust from hitting the ground
 - countdown for launch to ensure everyone is prepared
  - anyone can stop count down at any time
 - if rocket fails to ignite safety interlocks on and 1 minute wait before anyone approaches rocket
 - launch trajectory direct up as possible for obvious reasons
 - eye goggles for all participants

#### 2.6 - Unforeseen Events
#### 2.6.1 - Member of public
- if has a complaint contact *specific staff member* which team will have contact of
- team members are to direct public to andre for generic confrontation
- if safety threat then launch suspended until andre resolves

#### 2.6.2 - Faulty Components
  - if components faulty motor removed then team can attempt to fix
  - if motor faulty wait 1 min then Andre approaches then provides all clear
