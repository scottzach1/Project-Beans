## Analysis of 2018 safety plans

- disclaimer that it's only valid till first milestone
- Name
- Project Name
- Start and End Data
- Risk Profile
- Highest risk in project

## Planning
> Zac Launch details, travel plans and environment subsections <br>
> Finn: Front cover, and The rocket <br>
> Will: Launch, unforeseen events, fault components and supervision.

## Section 1 - The Rocket
- maximum weight 
- maximum length
- motor specs
- OpenRocket for test simulations
 - Results of the simulations - estimates/averages
 - worst case scenario based on sims
- no metal parts (complying with **NZ Model Rocketry Safety Code**)
- ignition safety locks
- **CAA requirements** of 20 Newtown-seconds impulse is not met so technically isn't a rocket
- no recovery charge required so is deactivated
- designed to tumble after burnout
- **New Zealand Rocketry Association safety code**
  - minimum dimensions of launch clear zone respective to motor (C class)

## Section 2 - Launch Details
 - see launch documents

#### 2.1 - Travel Plan
 - heat required for ignition (288°)
  - rocket must be kept away from any source of heat > 50°
 - at all times multiple persons of contact present
  - mitigate getting lost or injured
  - mobile phones for communication
 - rocket classified as Class 1 Dangerous Goods according to **Land Transport Rule: Dangerous Goods 2005**
 - designated member of staff contacted upon return to confirm safety of participants
  - if designated member receives no contact within an hour after expected arrival they should take emrgency
   - this action is laid out in launch documents

#### 2.2 - Environment
 - **CAA regulations Part 101.157 and Part 101.159**
  - flight during daylight hours
  - flight cancelled under following weather conditions:
    - Cloud cover which obscures more than half of the visible sky
    - Conditions which limit horizontal visibility to less than 8km.
    - Heavy precipitation
    - High wind speed (speeds exceeding 32 km/h)
  - resources to check conditions
    - Accuweather - hourly expected wind speeds / wind gust speeds
    - Wind Finder - live data - wind speed and dir
    - Metservice - three hourly weather measurements
  - not launched into clouds (**CAA regulations Part 101.157**)
  - all members of general public using park at launch time notified
    - if they refuse to comply or >10 members of public launch must be postponed
  - throughout launch three members stationed at max launch radius to ensure general public do not enter zone

#### 2.3 Equipment
 - checklist of all gear and owner

#### 2.4 Supervision
 - supervised by Andre
  - has Andre responsible for:
    - launch
    - deactivation
    - transportation
    - launch rail and pad
 - **we should probably meet/ask him about this**

#### 2.5 - Launch
 - NOTAM
  - as per  **CAA regulations Part 101.161** traffic control does not require notification
  - hills and buildings nearby are closer than max  height of rocket therefore no aircraft
 - safety inspection upon arrival
  - flammable materials in a 3 metre radius around the launcher removed **NZ Rocketry Association
safety code Section 2-14.2**
  - if necessary a blast deflector will be used to prevent the motor’s exhaust from hitting the ground
 - countdown for launch to ensure everyone is prepared
  - anyone can stop count down at any time
 - if rocket fails to ignite safety interlocks on and 1 minute wait before anyone approaches rocket
 - launch trajectory direct up as possible for obvious reasons
 - eye goggles for all participants

#### 2.6 - Unforeseen Events
#### 2.6.1 - Member of public
- if has a complaint contact *specific staff member* which team will have contact of
- team members are to direct public to andre for generic confrontation
- if safety threat then launch suspended until andre resolves

#### 2.6.2 - Faulty Components
  - if components faulty motor removed then team can attempt to fix
  - if motor faulty wait 1 min then Andre approaches then provides all clear
