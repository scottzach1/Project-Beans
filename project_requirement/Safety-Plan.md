### 2.4 Supervision
Launch procedure will be overseen by Andre Geldenhuis. Andre is a member of the
NZ Rocketry Association and is an expert in the field of Model Rocketry. As such
Andre will be responsible for the launch and deactivation of recovered charges
as necessary. Andre will be responsible for transporting the required
motors to and from the launch site, a procedure he is well familiar with. The
launch rail and pad will also be provided by Andre.

### 2.5 Launch
As per CAA regulations part(101.161), Air Traffic Control does not require prior
notice to any launch attempts as the rocket is classified under CAA regulations
as a, "large model rocket" part(101.3). Additionally, features of the
surrounding landscape i.e hills and trees are likely to dwarf the maximum
apogee of the rocket minimizing the risk of interference from foreign aircraft.

Upon arriving at the launch destination, team members will conduct a safety
inspection of the surroundings. Any hazards will be noted and procedure
deemed necessary to help mitigate these hazards will be conducted accordingly.
As required by the NZRA Safety Code, team members will ensure there is no dry
grass close to the launch pad which could present a risk of grass fire. A blast
deflector will also remain in place under the rocket to prevent the motor's
exhaust from hitting the ground and further minimise risk of fire.

The rocket will be launched at an angle no greater than 30 degrees to the
vertical to ensure the rocket lands within close proximity to the launch pad.
Once all participants have approved of the launch arrangmenets, Andre Geldenhuis
will activate the launch sequence.

In keeping with NZRA Safety Code, software will implement a 10 second countdown
timer. Once started, this timer can be cancelled remotely at the request of
any team member. This will ensure all particapants are notified and prepared
for launch. In the event of a misfire, safety interlocks will be put back in
place and the team will remain on standby for a full minute before approaching
the rocket.

### 2.6 Unforeseen Events
#### 2.6.1 Members of the Public
Due to the launch occuring on public premises, members of the public may
approach team members or otherwise pose a safety threat. In any such event,
the individual will be referred to Andre. Any complaints or enquireies that
cannot be handled onsight will be passed on to Aaron Chen.

#### 2.6.2 Faulty Components
If a component of the rocket is found to be faulty prior to launch, Andre will
remove the motor and the team will attempt to fix the component. Otherwise, if
any issues are identified with the motors Andre will, after waiting a minute,
approach the rocket and inspect the motor to determine whether it is safe before
permitting any team members to approach.
